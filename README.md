# Gomoku
This is my first big personal project!!
I started this project because I was wondaring how some games implement Human vs Computer game mode.
This project game me a chance to see various types of AI. As a first step, I used monte carlo tree search to determine the best move for computer.

# Live Demo

# Technologies
<ul>
<li>HTML</li>
<li>CSS</li>
<li>JavaScript</li>
<li>jQuery</li>
<li>Python (I used python to debug as it is my strong suit)</li>
</ul>

# Objectives
<ol>
      <li>To make working gomoku board </li>
      <li>To make the game generalize
            <ol>
                  <li>so that player can change the size of the board.</li>
            </ol>
      </li>
      <li>To identify if a user won.</li>
      <li>To implement vs-Computer-mode (decision making with monte carlo tree search.) 
            <ol>
                  <li>I think 4 x 4 board is max for MCTS because it will take a lot of time to compute bigger board. </li>
                  <li>Chanllenge 5 x 5.</li>
            </ol>
      </li>
      <li>Let computers play game with itself to make game record data</li>
</ol>

# Next Step
I am planning to implement another type of AI which uses Convolutional Nural Network to determine the best move based on the current board state.
Further more, my ultimate goal is to make various types of AI and visualize which AI(or algorithm) is the best for specific situation(board size, maximum computation time...).
