# Gomoku

This is my first big personal project!!
I use the following technologies for this prokect;
<ul>
<li>HTML</li>
<li>CSS</li>
<li>JavaScript</li>
<li>jQuery</li>
<li>tensorflow.js</li>
</ul>

Scope of this project is...
<ol>
      <li>To make working gomoku board </li>
      <li>To make the game generalize
            <ol>
                  <li>so that player can change the size of the board.</li>
                  <li>so that # of players is flexible.</li>
            </ol>
      </li>
      <li>To identify if a user won.</li>
      <li>To implement vs-Computer-mode (decision making with monte carlo tree search.) 
            <ol>
                  <li>I think 4 x 4 board is max for MCTS because it will take a lot of time to compute bigger board. </li>
                  <li>Chanllenge 5 x 5.</li>
            </ol>
      </li>
      <li>Let computers play game with itself to make game record data</li>
      <li>Use that record to train CNN model which takes current status as input and outputs the best move</li>
</ol>
