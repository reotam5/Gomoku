This project demonstrate use of
<ul>
<li>HTML</li>
<li>CSS</li>
<li>JavaScript</li>
<li>jQuery</li>
</ul>

Scope of this project is...
1) To make working tic tac toe board 
2) To make the game generalize
      2-i)so that player can change the size of the board.
      2-ii)so that # of players can vary.
3) To identify if a user won.
4) To implement vs-Computer-mode with monte carlo tree search
      4-i)I think 3 x 3 board is max because it will take a lot of time to compute.
      4-ii)Chanllenge 4 x 4 monte carlo tree search.
